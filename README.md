npm run start:ai
```

## Quick Start - Standard Mode
1. Clone the repository
2. Configure environment variables
3. Run deployment script with `--experimental` flag
4. Monitor system through AI dashboard

## AI Integration
Our system now uses machine learning to:
- Predict optimal deployment times
- Auto-scale based on predicted load
- Detect anomalies before they cause issues
- Suggest configuration improvements
